   ```

---

## Project Installation

### Step 1: Clone or Download the Project

```bash
# If using Git
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd airbnb-market-scraping-system

# Or extract the tar.gz file
tar -xzf airbnb-scraper.tar.gz
cd airbnb-scraper
```

### Step 2: Install Go Dependencies

```bash
# Initialize Go modules (if not already done)
go mod tidy

# This will download:
# - chromedp (browser automation)
# - lib/pq (PostgreSQL driver)
# - yaml.v3 (config parsing)
```

### Step 3: Start PostgreSQL Database

```bash
# Start PostgreSQL in Docker
docker-compose up -d

# Verify it's running
docker ps

# You should see: airbnb-postgres container running on port 5432

# Check logs if needed
docker-compose logs postgres
```

### Step 4: Verify Database Connection

```bash
# Connect to database
docker exec -it airbnb-postgres psql -U postgres -d airbnb_scraper

# You should see:
# airbnb_scraper=#

# Check tables (should see 'listings' table)
\dt

# Exit
\q
```

### Step 5: Configure the Scraper

Create a config.yaml file inside the config folder.

```bash
touch config/config.yaml
```
> !! For the assignment checking purpose, I've pushed the file so that it would be less hassle to review the project. So, there is no need to create the file. Although this file doesn't contain any sensitive information, it is still not the best practice.

**Key settings to review:**

```yaml
scraper:
  base_url: "https://www.airbnb.com"  # Don't change
  max_pages: 2                         # Pages per location
  properties_per_page: 5               # Properties per page
  max_workers: 3                       # Concurrent workers
  delay_min_ms: 2000                   # Min delay (increase if blocked)
  delay_max_ms: 5000                   # Max delay (increase if blocked)
  headless: false                      # true = no browser window
  
database:
  host: "localhost"
  port: 5432
  user: "postgres"                     # Change if you modified docker-compose
  password: "postgres"                 # Change if you modified docker-compose
  dbname: "airbnb_scraper"
```

### Step 6: Test Installation

```bash
# Run a quick test
go run main.go --show-stats

# If the database is empty, it should show:
# Total listings: 0

# If you see this without errors, installation is successful! ✅
```

### Step 7: Start Scraping:

```bash
go run main.go
```

**If you face any error like the following**
```
25023:25023:0220/005324.205998:ERROR:ui/gtk/gtk_ui.cc:251] Schema org.gnome.desktop.interface does not have key font-antialiasing
qt.qpa.plugin: Could not find the Qt platform plugin "wayland" in ""
This application failed to start because no Qt platform plugin could be initialized. Reinstalling the application may fix this problem.
Available platform plugins are: eglfs, linuxfb, minimal, minimalegl, offscreen, vnc, xcb.
exit status 1
```
**Install the following libraries and then run the project again**
```bash
sudo apt-get install -y chromium-browser libnss3 libgtk-3-0t64 libgbm1
```

**OR, you can set `headless = true` in the *config.yaml* file and run the project. In that case, you will not see the Chrome browser pop-up managed by the scraper.**

## ⚙️ Configuration

### Database Configuration

**Using default Docker setup** (recommended):
- The `docker-compose.yml` already sets up PostgreSQL
- Default credentials: `postgres:postgres`
- Database name: `airbnb_scraper`
- Port: `5432`

---

### Scraper Configuration

**For aggressive scraping** (risk of being blocked):
```yaml
delay_min_ms: 1000
delay_max_ms: 2000
max_workers: 5
headless: true
```

**For safe scraping** (recommended):
```yaml
delay_min_ms: 3000
delay_max_ms: 7000
max_workers: 2
headless: false
```

**If you get blocked** (503 errors):
```yaml
delay_min_ms: 5000
delay_max_ms: 10000
max_workers: 2
headless: true
max_retries: 5
```

---

### Full Scraping Workflow

```bash
# Run the complete scraping process
go run main.go
```

**This will:**
1. Visit the Airbnb homepage
2. Extract all visible location cards
3. For each location:
   - Scrape page 1 (first 5 properties)
   - Scrape page 2 (first 5 properties)
4. Scrape detail pages (bedrooms, bathrooms, guests)
5. Save to PostgreSQL database
6. Export to CSV file (`listings.csv`)
7. Display analytics summary

**Expected runtime**: 5-15 minutes (depends on the number of locations and delays)

### Headless Mode (No Browser Window)

```bash
# Edit config first
# Set headless: true in config/config.yaml

go run main.go
```

### Watch the Browser (Debug Mode)

```bash
# Set headless: false in config/config.yaml
go run main.go

# You'll see Chrome windows opening and navigating
# Useful for debugging or understanding the process
```

##  CLI Commands

##  How It Works

### 1. Homepage Location Discovery

```
Airbnb Homepage → Extract location cards → Get URLs for each location
Example: Sydney, Paris, Tokyo, Melbourne, Bangkok, etc.
```

### 2. Property Scraping

```
For each location:
  Page 1 → Extract 20 cards → Take first 5
  Page 2 → Extract 20 cards → Take first 5
  Total: 10 properties per location
```

### 3. Detail Page Scraping (Concurrent)

```
3 Workers process detail pages in parallel:
  Worker 1: Property 1, 4, 7, 10...
  Worker 2: Property 2, 5, 8, 11...
  Worker 3: Property 3, 6, 9, 12...

Each worker:
  - Visits detail page
  - Extracts bedrooms, bathrooms, guests
  - Retries up to 3 times on failure
```

### 4. Data Processing

```
Raw Data → Normalization → Database Storage
  - Price: "$120" → 120.00
  - Rating: "4.95 (123 reviews)" → 4.95
  - URL: Remove query params for deduplication
  - Location: Extract from title
```

### 5. Deduplication

```
Unique constraint on URL prevents duplicates
If URL exists: UPDATE existing record
If URL new: INSERT new record
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Issue: "503 Service Unavailable" or No Listings Found

**Cause**: Airbnb has temporarily blocked your IP due to too many requests.

**Solutions**:
1. **Wait 30-60 minutes** before trying again
2. **Increase delays** in `config/config.yaml`:
   ```yaml
   delay_min_ms: 5000  # 5 seconds
   delay_max_ms: 10000 # 10 seconds
   ```
3. **Run in headless mode**: Set `headless: true`
4. **Reduce workers**: Set `max_workers: 2`
5. **Use VPN or different network** if persistent

### Issue: "Failed to connect to database."

**Solutions**:
```bash
# Check if PostgreSQL is running
docker ps

# If not running, start it
docker-compose up -d

# Check logs
docker-compose logs postgres

# Restart containers
docker-compose restart

# If still fails, recreate containers
docker-compose down -v
docker-compose up -d
```

### Issue: "Chrome not found" or Browser Errors

**Solutions**:
```bash
# Mac
brew install --cask google-chrome

# Ubuntu
sudo apt-get install chromium-browser

# Verify installation
which google-chrome
which chromium-browser
```

### Issue: Duplicate Data in Database

**Cause**: URL normalization isn't working or Airbnb changed URL structure.

**Check**:
```sql
-- Connect to database
docker exec -it airbnb-postgres psql -U postgres -d airbnb_scraper

-- Check for duplicates
SELECT url, COUNT(*) FROM listings GROUP BY url HAVING COUNT(*) > 1;

-- If duplicates exist, clear and re-scrape
TRUNCATE listings RESTART IDENTITY;
```

### Issue: Title and Location Are the Same

**Cause**: Airbnb changed their HTML structure.


### Issue: Detail Pages Timeout

**Cause**: Detail pages take longer than 60 seconds to load.

**Solution**: Increase timeout in `scraper/airbnb/detail_scraper.go`:
```go
browserCtx, cancel = context.WithTimeout(browserCtx, 90*time.Second)
```

### Issue: Memory Issues During Scraping

**Solutions**:
1. Reduce `max_workers` to 2
2. Enable headless mode: `headless: true`
3. Reduce pages: `max_pages: 1`
4. Close other applications

##  Best Practices

### For Ethical Scraping

1. **Respect robots.txt**: Be polite, use reasonable delays
2. **Rate limiting**: Don't overwhelm Airbnb's servers
3. **User-agent**: Use realistic user agent strings
4. **Off-peak hours**: Run scraper during low-traffic times
5. **Personal use**: Don't republish or sell scraped data
6. **Check terms**: Review Airbnb's Terms of Service
